# DiabeTech - Diabetes Prediction Model
DiabeTech is a machine learning project that aims to predict diabetes risk based on various features and data points. This README provides an overview of the project, how to use it, and how to contribute.

# Used ~
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the class or value of a data point by looking at the majority class or averaging values of its nearest neighbors in the training dataset. KNN is non-parametric, sensitive to distance metrics and the value of 'k,' and is effective for non-linear problems with smaller datasets.
